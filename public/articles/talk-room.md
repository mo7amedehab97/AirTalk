## What Exactly Is a Talk Room?

A talk room is a live audio chat space where people talk using their microphone.  

There’s no camera. No typing. No profile pictures.  
You just join the room, speak, and listen — like a casual group phone [call with strangers](https://www.airtalk.live) or friends.

Most talk rooms offer:

- One-on-one or group voice chats  
- Anonymous joining (no sign-up needed)  
- Interest-based rooms (music, mental health, gaming)  
- Real-time interaction without delays  

It’s as simple as that. You talk, they talk, and you connect — all with your voice.
