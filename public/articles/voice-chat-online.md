## What is Voice Chat Online?

[Voice chat online](https://www.airtalk.live) lets you talk to people over the internet using your voice. It uses VoIP technology (Voice over Internet Protocol) that converts your voice into digital data and sends it in real time.  
You can use voice chat for free through many websites directly. It works on most devices, including:

- Smartphones (iOS and Android)  
- Laptops and desktop computers  
- Tablets and web browsers  

With a working internet connection, a microphone, and speakers or headphones, you're ready to start chatting.

## The Importance of Online Voice Conversing

### Personal and Engaging  
A voice, of course, adds tone, emotion, warmth. It forms an actual human connection that is far stronger than text or emojis.

### Fast and Simple  
There is little need to type long messages when you can say them in seconds. It's also much more efficient to leave one voicemail instead of sending a bunch of texts.

### Easy to Multitask  
You can hop on voice chat online while you’re busy cooking, working or gaming. It doesn’t get in the way (while not moving that fast).

### Meet New People  
It’s fun to voice chat with strangers. It allows you to meet real people from around the world.

## How Voice Chat Online Works

[Voice chat](https://www.airtalk.live/blog/voice-chat-for-visually-impaired/) technology may sound simple on its face, but in the back end, there is an enormous amount happening to enable real-time conversation. Here's how it works:

1. **Voice Capture**: Your microphone captures your voice as an audio signal.  
2. **Converting the sound**: This audio signal is translated into tiny digital data packets by the use of VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol) technology.  
3. **Transmission Over the Internet**: These packets are then sent to the internet servers that will forward them to the person you are communicating with.  
4. **(Re-assembly) Reassemble**: The destination recreates the original data into a new audio play.  
5. **Playback**: The sound then plays through the other person’s speakers or headphones so quickly that it is almost instant.  

Due to data compression improvements and advances in internet speed, this whole process takes just milliseconds. That’s what makes voice chat so effortless and so natural, practically like having a conversation in person, no matter how far away.

| Hands-Free Use | Yes                              | Not always                             |
